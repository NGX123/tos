# Booting on x86-64(Bootloader)
* GRUB2 EFI - boots into protected mode
    * [Guide(On the osdev guide do not run insmod, set and configfile commands)](https://wiki.osdev.org/GRUB#GRUB_for_UEFI)
        1. First disk file should be created and formated with EFI/BOOT directory on it
        2. Create a grub.cfg with a bootentry like always, but the path of the kernel executable should start with hd0(other other disk name) and instead of `multiboot` before executable, `multiboot2` should be used e.g. `multiboot2 (hd0)/efi/boot/file.bin`
        3. Then grub bootloader executable should be made with(the config file has same syntax as before but to boot with multiboot 2 instead of one use `menuentry {mulitboot2 (disk)/directory})
            *   ```sh
                grub-mkstandalone -O x86_64-efi -o BOOTX64.EFI "boot/grub/grub.cfg(This is where file will be put ondisk)=build/grub.cfg(This is the location of the config file on computer"
                ```
        4. Then the grub executable should be copied into /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI and kernel should be copied into path specified by grub.cfg
        5. The image now can be inserted into emulator/VM and run

# Long Mode
## Guide(personal understanding)
### Check Long Mode availability using CPUID
1. [The presence of CPUID should be checked(otherwise imposible to know if long mode is available so fail)](https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Long_Mode#Detection_of_CPUID)
2. If the CPUID is present the presence of CPUID extended functions should be checked(if missing fail for same reaseon as before)
3. [Finally if CPUID and it's extended functions are present the presence of the long mode should be checked in the CPUID extended functions flags](https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Long_Mode#x86_or_x86-64)

### Switch from protected mode to long mode(Intel Developer Manual - p. 3131(9.8.5))
1. Disable protected mode paging(clear paging bit) - `CR0.PG = 0`
2. Enable PAE(set PAE bit) - `CR4.PAE = 1`
3. Load CR3 with address of level 4 page table(PML4)
4. Enable long mode(set long mode biy in EFER model specific register) - `IA32_EFER.LME = 1`(Read on how to write/read model specific registers to do it)
5. Enable paging(set paging bit) - `CR0.PG = 1`
6. After enabling everything before the CPU is in compatibility mode which is still 32 bit and to make the final switch it should load the new 64-Bit GDT instead of the old one for the 32bit/protected mode(The 64bit GDT has some differences in bit meanings - described in Intel Manual 3.4.5)
7. There should be a long jump(using code selector offset as offset) to the 64-Bit code and then the CPU is finally in long mode

### Long Mode Switch Caveats
* [Red Zone             - ABI of 64-bit mode, that has to be taken into account not to overwrite ISRs](https://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=21720)
* [Linker script notes  - how common can brake the kernel](https://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?p=170634)


## Information
* Bootstrap paging - when switching to long mode no VMM(virtual memory manager) or anything hard is needed to use paging, but the addresses where the kernel is located(1MB + kernel_size) should be mapped on the physical memory. Easy way to map is just to identity map the first 1GB of memory by using huge(1GB) pages and mapping one page to the start of memory(1GB). Later, once in long mode with full kernel loaded the tables that identity map the first GB could be changed by loading new address in cr3 and setting up normal paging
* Paging on x86 - a series of tables(amount depends on the mode) are used to map pages. Each table has 512 entries which point to a table of lower level and the last table's entries point to pages. In some of the tables individual(one by one and not all at once) entries could be changed from pointing to a whole table, to point to just one page of a size of the whole table.
	* It is recommended to map kernel at `address + 1MB` and use the address to map the first MB of RAM which is used for UEFI/BIOS
* [Noncanonical Addresses and the big gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Virtual_address_space_details) - on x86_64 only 47/55 bits are used in addresses and the manual states that bits 48-63/56-63 should be the same as 47/55th bit and that means that techinically bit 48/56 is available(as all last bits techinically act as the last bit of the address) and that means that in addition to the first 256 TiB(in 48 bit addressing, in 56-Bit it would be more), the last 256 TiB are also accessible and between them there is a gigantic hole of addresses that could not be accessed(or otherwise bits 48-63/56-63 would not be the same as 47/55th bit), the size of the hole decreases as more bits of address are used(when using 56-Bit addressing, the hole is smaller then when using 47-Bit addressing)
	* Canonical Lower Half - the first 256TiB(In 48-Bit addressing, in 56-Bit it would be more) that could be accessed
	* Noncanonical addresses - addresses that could not be accessed because of the the restriction where unused bits should be the same as the last used(47/57)
	* Canonical Higher Half - the last 256TiB(In 48-Bit addressing, in 56-Bit it would be more) that could be accessed
		* Higher Half starts at address 0xffffffff80100000(in 48-bit addressing)

## Questions
### Current
- Do the [BITS 32/64] really matter or they can be ignored because I understand linker script still inserts 64-Bit addresses but OS still works, and what do they really do?

### Solved
- Long Mode
	+ How do i check that red-zone was disabled and long mode was enabled on running OS?
		* Write largest possible 64 bit value into RAX and check if the full value stays there(if yes - long mode switch happened)
	+ When portions of assembly code are `[BITS 32]` and some are `[BITS 64]` what should the output format of assembler be(e.g. elf64/elf32)?
		* The section would be converted in any case of output format(does not matter which is output - e.g. elf32/64...), the output format for binary that would switch to long mode should be `elf64`
	+ Should the linkerscript changes be made for the reason above(parts of code with different bitness)?
		* No
	+ Should grub be changed to load elf64 binary?
		* No
	+ Will protected mode variables still work in long mode?
		* No
