# Booting on x86-64(Bootloader)
* GRUB2 EFI - boots into protected mode
    * [Guide(On the osdev guide do not run insmod, set and configfile commands)](https://wiki.osdev.org/GRUB#GRUB_for_UEFI)
        1. First disk file should be created and formated with EFI/BOOT directory on it
        2. Create a grub.cfg with a bootentry like always, but the path of the kernel executable should start with hd0(other other disk name) and instead of `multiboot` before executable, `multiboot2` should be used e.g. `multiboot2 (hd0)/efi/boot/file.bin`
        3. Then grub bootloader executable should be made with(the config file has same syntax as before but to boot with multiboot 2 instead of one use `menuentry {mulitboot2 (disk)/directory})
            *   ```sh
                grub-mkstandalone -O x86_64-efi -o BOOTX64.EFI "boot/grub/grub.cfg(This is where file will be put ondisk)=build/grub.cfg(This is the location of the config file on computer"
                ```
        4. Then the grub executable should be copied into /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI and kernel should be copied into path specified by grub.cfg
        5. The image now can be inserted into emulator/VM and run

# Long Mode
## Guide(personal understanding)
### Check Long Mode availability using CPUID
1. [The presence of CPUID should be checked(otherwise imposible to know if long mode is available so fail)](https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Long_Mode#Detection_of_CPUID)
2. If the CPUID is present the presence of CPUID extended functions should be checked(if missing fail for same reaseon as before)
3. [Finally if CPUID and it's extended functions are present the presence of the long mode should be checked in the CPUID extended functions flags](https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Long_Mode#x86_or_x86-64)

### Switch from protected mode to long mode(Intel Developer Manual - p. 3131(9.8.5))
1. Disable protected mode paging(clear paging bit) - `CR0.PG = 0`
2. Enable PAE(set PAE bit) - `CR4.PAE = 1`
3. Load CR3 with address of level 4 page table(PML4)
4. Enable long mode(set long mode biy in EFER model specific register) - `IA32_EFER.LME = 1`(Read on how to write/read model specific registers to do it)
5. Enable paging(set paging bit) - `CR0.PG = 1`
6. After enabling everything before the CPU is in compatibility mode which is still 32 bit and to make the final switch it should load the new 64-Bit GDT instead of the old one for the 32bit/protected mode(The 64bit GDT has some differences in bit meanings - described in Intel Manual 3.4.5)
7. There should be a long jump(using code selector offset as offset) to the 64-Bit code and then the CPU is finally in long mode

## Questions
### Current
### Solved
- Long Mode
	+ How do i check that red-zone was disabled and long mode was enabled on running OS?
		* Write largest possible 64 bit value into RAX and check if the full value stays there(if yes - long mode switch happened)
	+ When portions of assembly code are `[BITS 32]` and some are `[BITS 64]` what should the output format of assembler be(e.g. elf64/elf32)?
		* The section would be converted in any case of output format(does not matter which is output - e.g. elf32/64...), the output format for binary that would switch to long mode should be `elf64`
	+ Should the linkerscript changes be made for the reason above(parts of code with different bitness)?
		* No
	+ Should grub be changed to load elf64 binary?
		* No
	+ Will protected mode variables still work in long mode?
		* No
