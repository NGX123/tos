++ BOOT ++
    - UEFI requires an efi application to be located on an FAT/16/32 formated drive
        - First the drive should be made and then PE executable should be put on it
    - The application needs to be in the windows PE executable format. Compilers on linux mostly produce ELF which should be converted to PE
        - The conversion from ELF to be PE is done by copying only certain entries from the ELF file using objcopy

++ DEVELOPMENT ++
    - To call the UEFI functions the app should have headers included and be linked with shared libs where they are defined
        - TianoCore EDK2(https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Getting-Started-with-EDK-II). Large complex environment that should be compiled and configured
        - GNU-EFI(https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnu-efi/). Libraries and headers that can be installed as packages and don't require configuration
    - When EFI App is compiled several command line attributes should be passed
        - -fno-stack-protector  - Disable variable app at the end of stack that indicates overflow when overwritten
        - -fpic                 - Position independent code(can be loaded anywhere in memory)
        - -fshort-wchar         - Makes wchar_t short(2 byte)
        - -mno-red-zone         - Disables red zone feature according to amd64 ABI
        - CALLING ATTRIBUTE     - this attribute is specific to the compiler used and changes calling convention to windows one(used by UEFI)
            - clang - -DHAVE_USE_MS_ABI
            - gcc   - -DEFI_FUNCTION_WRAPPER
