-- List of possible bugs --
string.c
    + strstr() -> size of length variables was changed from int to size_t
    + multiple functions -> removed the const qualiefier to mute the warning, unlikely but may cause some problems if there is a bug in code and const var gets changed
		+ strlen() and strnlen() -> changed implementations and variable types
