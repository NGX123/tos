init.c
  + In all occurances of toggleBit(), when passing variable warning occurs(type incompatible with size_t*). So in all occurances conversion to size_t was added (e.g. toggleBit((size_t*)var) )
    - Possible source of overflows, stack corruption...
  + When merging two parts of an address into one(2 uint32_t into 1 uint64_t), the problem could occur becuase before typecast to uint64_t was added(the one before bit left shift) there was a warning
