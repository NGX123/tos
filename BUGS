+ stdio.c
  + printf does not support multiple modes and does not support 64bit integers

-- List of possible bugs --
init.c
  + In all occurances of toggleBit(), when passing variable warning occurs(type incompatible with size_t*). So in all occurances conversion to size_t was added (e.g. toggleBit((size_t*)var) )
    - Possible source of overflows, stack corruption...
  + In init.c if printf is used for printing memory map contents - it will output garbage until all values passed to it are smaller 32-bit or smaller(can be typecasted) becuase printf does not support 64bit numbers
